This repository contains the source code and documentation for a simple yet powerful Todo application. The app is designed to help users keep track of their tasks and stay organized throughout their busy lives.

The app is built using modern web technologies such as React, Node for backend, and Node-Persist, making it highly scalable, maintainable, and reliable. It features a sleek and intuitive user interface that is easy to use and navigate, and it supports all major browsers and devices.


I have used node-persist local storage which is an asynchronous persistent data structure in Node.js

As there is no network overhead, node-persist is just about as fast as a database can get.
